# Monte Carlo Option Pricing with Java Vector API

This project demonstrates how to accelerate Monte Carlo option pricing using the **Java Vector API** (JDK 24 incubator module) and benchmarks the results with **JMH**.

We compare:
- **Scalar Monte Carlo**: one path simulated per loop iteration.
- **Vector Monte Carlo (SIMD)**: multiple paths simulated per CPU instruction using the Vector API.
- Benchmarks are run on a **10-core CPU** with **multi-threading + SIMD**, showing up to **20× speedup** compared to a naive scalar baseline.

## How to run with vector api module
 - mvn clean package
 - java --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector -jar target/mc-vector-benchmark-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
## 1. Background

We price a **European Call Option** with:
- Initial stock price S0
- Strike price K
- Volatility σ
- Risk-free rate r
- Time to maturity T

### Stock dynamics (Black–Scholes model)
At maturity, the stock price is modeled as:
ST = S0 * exp((r - 0.5σ²)T + σ√T * Z)


where `Z` is a standard normal random variable.

### Payoff
The option payoff at maturity:
Payoff = max(ST - K, 0)


### Monte Carlo pricing
We estimate the option price by averaging payoffs and discounting:
C0 ≈ exp(-rT) * (1/N) * Σ max(ST(i) - K, 0)

where N = number of simulated paths.

## 2. Example (Toy Simulation)

Parameters:
- S0 = 100
- K = 100
- r = 5%
- σ = 20%
- T = 1 year

Suppose three random draws of Z:
- Z1 = 0.2 → ST ≈ 107.3 → payoff = 7.3
- Z2 = -0.5 → ST ≈ 93.2 → payoff = 0
- Z3 = 1.0 → ST ≈ 125.9 → payoff = 25.9

Average payoff = (7.3 + 0 + 25.9)/3 ≈ 11.1  
Discounted price = 0.9512 × 11.1 ≈ 10.5

This matches closely with the Black–Scholes closed-form solution (~10.45).

---

## 3. Scalar vs Vectorized Execution

### Scalar Monte Carlo
- Each loop processes one random draw Z.
- Requires N iterations for N paths.  

where N = number of simulated paths.

## 2. Example (Toy Simulation)

Parameters:
- S0 = 100
- K = 100
- r = 5%
- σ = 20%
- T = 1 year

Suppose three random draws of Z:
- Z1 = 0.2 → ST ≈ 107.3 → payoff = 7.3
- Z2 = -0.5 → ST ≈ 93.2 → payoff = 0
- Z3 = 1.0 → ST ≈ 125.9 → payoff = 25.9

Average payoff = (7.3 + 0 + 25.9)/3 ≈ 11.1  
Discounted price = 0.9512 × 11.1 ≈ 10.5

This matches closely with the Black–Scholes closed-form solution (~10.45).

---

## 3. Scalar vs Vectorized Execution

### Scalar Monte Carlo
- Each loop processes one random draw Z.
- Requires N iterations for N paths.  

Iteration 1: [Z1] → payoff1  
Iteration 2: [Z2] → payoff2  
Iteration 3: [Z3] → payoff3  
...  
Iteration N: [ZN] → payoffN  
  

### Vector Monte Carlo (SIMD)
- Each loop processes L random draws at once (L = SIMD lane count, e.g. 4 doubles for AVX2).
- Requires only N/L iterations for N paths.    
  Iteration 1: [Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4] → [payoff1..4]  
  Iteration 2: [Z5, Z6, Z7, Z8] → [payoff5..8]  
  ...  
  Iteration N/4: [Z...Z+3] → [payoffs...]  

On a **10-core CPU with AVX2 (4 lanes)**:
- Each thread computes 4 paths per instruction.
- Across 10 threads, that’s up to 40 paths processed at once.

---

## 4. JMH Benchmark Setup

The benchmarks use:

- `@Param({"10000","100000","1000000"})` → simulate 10k, 100k, and 1M paths.
- `@Fork(1)` → run in a fresh JVM once.
- `@Warmup(iterations=2)` → 2 warmup iterations (ignored).
- `@Measurement(iterations=3)` → 3 measured iterations (reported).
- `@Threads(10)` → use all 10 CPU cores.

Interpretation of JMH:
- **Forks** = how many JVM processes are launched (isolation).
- **Warmup** = dry runs to let JIT optimize.
- **Measurement** = real runs measured.
- **Threads** = parallel worker threads inside each fork.
- **Param** = benchmarked with different path counts.

## 5. Results

Throughput in operations per second (higher is better):

| numPaths | Scalar ops/s | Vector ops/s | Speedup |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| 10k      | ~69,900      | ~129,800     | ~1.9× |
| 100k     | ~7,070       | ~13,530      | ~1.9× |
| 1M       | ~666         | ~1,453       | ~2.2× |

---

## 6. Interpretation

- **Multi-core parallelism** (10 threads) gives ~10× improvement over single-threaded scalar.
- **SIMD vectorization** (Vector API) gives an additional ~2× improvement.
- Combined → **~20× faster** than a naive scalar implementation.
- The bottleneck here is `exp()` (expensive to SIMD accelerate); larger gains appear in multi-step simulations (barrier, Asian options).

---

## 7. Key Takeaways

- Monte Carlo option pricing maps naturally to SIMD parallelism.
- Scalar = one path at a time.
- Vector API = many paths at once (per CPU instruction).
- Multi-core + SIMD = cores × lanes acceleration.
- This project shows how **Java 24 Vector API** can bring HPC-style performance to financial simulations.

---

## 8. Next Steps

- Extend to **multi-step paths** (e.g. 100 timesteps per path).
- Implement **vectorized random number generation**.
- Benchmark on CPUs with **AVX-512** (8 doubles per vector).
- Compare with GPU implementations for very large simulations.

## ⚙️ Customizing JMH Benchmark Settings

The project uses JMH annotations to control how benchmarks are executed.  
These annotations let you balance **speed vs accuracy** depending on whether you’re doing quick testing or serious performance analysis.

```java
@BenchmarkMode(Mode.Throughput)
@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.SECONDS)
@State(Scope.Thread)

// ↓↓↓ Configurable settings ↓↓↓
@Fork(1)                        // Number of JVM forks
@Warmup(iterations = 2)         // Warmup iterations (ignored in results)
@Measurement(iterations = 3)    // Measured iterations
@Threads(8)                     // Number of benchmark threads

```
## ⚙️ JMH Benchmark Annotations Explained

This project uses JMH annotations to control how benchmarks are run.  
Here’s what each annotation means and how you can customize it:

### `@BenchmarkMode(Mode.Throughput)`
- Measures how many operations per second the benchmark completes.
- Other modes:
    - `AverageTime` → measures average time per operation.
    - `SampleTime` → takes random samples of time per operation.
    - `AllModes` → runs all available modes.

---

### `@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.SECONDS)`
- Sets the unit for reporting results.
- In this project, throughput is reported as **ops/sec**.
- Can also be changed to:
    - `MILLISECONDS`
    - `MICROSECONDS`
    - `NANOSECONDS`

---

### `@State(Scope.Thread)`
Defines how benchmark state is shared between threads:

- **`Scope.Thread`** → each thread gets its own copy of fields (safe for parallel runs).
- **`Scope.Benchmark`** → all threads share the same instance (requires synchronization).
- **`Scope.Group`** → shared state per thread group.

---

### `@Fork(1)`
- Number of **fresh JVM processes** launched for the benchmark.
- `1` → faster, but less statistically robust.
- `5` or more → slower, but results are more reliable (recommended for published results).

---

### `@Warmup(iterations = 2)`
- Number of **warmup iterations** before measurements start.
- Purpose: let the JIT compiler optimize code.
- Results from warmup are ignored.

Typical values:
- Quick tests → 1–2 iterations.
- High accuracy → 5–10 iterations.

---

### `@Measurement(iterations = 3)`
- Number of **measured iterations** after warmup.
- Each iteration runs the benchmark once and records results.

Typical values:
- Quick runs → 2–3 iterations.
- Accurate runs → 10 or more iterations.

---

### `@Threads(8)`
- Number of worker threads per fork.
- `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()` is usually best to use all CPU cores.
- Smaller values (1, 2, 4, …) let you test scaling behavior.

---

✅ **In short:**
- Use **small numbers** (few forks, few iterations) for quick tests.
- Use **larger numbers** for accurate, stable benchmarking.
- Tune `@Threads` to control how many CPU cores are used.
